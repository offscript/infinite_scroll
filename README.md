Ajax Calls and an Infinite Scrolling Mechanism

In this project I retrieve JSON packaged information from http://www.omdbapi.com/ and then use jQuery to dynamically create HTML 
to display the retrieved information. In addition to this I employ an infinite scrolling method that retrieves more information from ajax when the user gets to the bottom of the page. Just press the browse button and get to scrolling through the database at your leisure. Here's the site: https://offscript.github.io/infinite_scroll/.
