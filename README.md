Ajax Calls and an Infinite Scrolling Mechanism

This project uses AJAX to retrieve JSON packaged information from http://www.omdbapi.com/ and then uses jQuery to dynamically create HTML for displaying the retrieved information. In addition to this I employ an infinite scrolling method that retrieves more information via AJAX when the user gets to the bottom of their window. Just press the browse button and get to scrolling through the database at your leisure.
